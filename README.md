# Local Gaming Mobility Assistant (LGMA)
LGMA allows you to download files from Google Drive using DZ without needing to use Nut or any other software.

## Setup
1) Complete the first step here (https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/python) and rename that file to "client_id.json".
2) Extract the ZIP from releases and put the "client_id.json" with wherever you extracted them.
3) Follow the steps in the program and hit "Start FTP Server".
4) Add a new entry to your switch/dz/locations.conf as shown in the program
5) Open DZ and it should show up there.
